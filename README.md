# SimpleCalculator
Hello, there Dear Programmers!😁

Welcome to my Workspace, since you are here I would like to tell you that, I am a fresher who has been interested in making small projects and I thought of why not make a simple "Calculator", it might not seem impressive but a lot of hard work has been gone through this.
I worked on this project for 5hrs and I have taken a lot of references as well and took help from the internet as well, but I did this to learn and experiment.
I hope you guys like it.😆

Happy Coding.........😊
